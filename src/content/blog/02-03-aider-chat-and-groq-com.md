# What is this about?

based on my experience about using a ai chat as a software developer and explainer 

written as a story in

https://github.com/roebi/02-02-roebi-game-prototype-with-p5js/blob/master/README.md

i would like to get experience with **aider.chat**

in this there are only the **installation steps** for aider.chat and a connection to groq.com

# feel free to install it in a similar way ...
